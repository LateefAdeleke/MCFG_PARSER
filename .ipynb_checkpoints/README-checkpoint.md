# MCFG_PARSER: An Agender-based Parser Package for MCFG

## Overview
MCFG is a python package designed for parsing natural languages using multiple context_free grammars (MCFGs). It implements an agenda_based parser to efficiently handle complex syntactic structures. This project leverages agenda_based parser formalism nas contained in Shieber et al. 1995 and utilizes inference rules laid out in Kallmeyer 2013, making it relevant to academic research and applications in computational linguistics.

## Features
